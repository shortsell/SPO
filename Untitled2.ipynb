In the event that, at any time between four months and one day following the closing date and the expiry date, the common shares trade on the TSX Venture Exchange at a closing price that is equal to or greater than 30 cents for a period of 10 consecutive trading days, the company may accelerate the expiry date of the warrants by giving notice to the holders thereof, and in such case the warrants will expire on the 30th day after the date such notice is provided.</p><p>Net proceeds of the offering are expected to be used to undertake further drilling at Contact Gold's Green Springs and Pony Creek gold projects located in Nevada, and for general working capital.</p><p>Green Springs project</p><p>In 2019, Contact Gold confirmed that past drilling at the Echo and Charlie zones hit entirely oxidized gold mineralization in four drill holes that were reassayed for cyanide solubility. Subsequently, Contact Gold started a drill program to follow up and extend oxide gold mineralization from in the known zones, and drilled 1,300 metres in 10 drill holes. Contact Gold recently reported new oxide gold discoveries at the Alpha and Echo zones.</p><p>The past-producing Green Springs gold project is located at the southern end of Nevada's prolific Carlin trend, 60 kilometres southwest of the historic mining centre of Ely, Nev., in a region hosting numerous producing and past-producing Carlin-type gold deposits. Green Springs encompasses 16 square kilometres and is approximately 10 kilometres east of Fiore Gold's Gold Rock project, 10 kilometres south of Waterton's Mt. Hamilton gold deposit and 20 kilometres southeast of Fiore Gold's producing Pan mine.</p><p>2019 drill highlights include:</p><ul class=\"bulleted-list arrowlist\"><li>4.09 grams per tonne gold over 38.10 metres in hole GS19-09 (Echo, news release dated Jan. 28, 2020);</li><li>1.02 g/t Au over 22.86 metres in hole GS19-10 (Bravo, news release dated Feb. 12, 2020);</li><li>1.68 g/t Au over 35.05 metres in hole GS19-03 (Alpha, news release dated Jan. 14, 2020).</li></ul><p>In 2020, the company anticipates continuing exploration on the Green Springs property. The company plans to grow discoveries at the Alpha and Echo zones as well as drill new target areas.</p><p>Pony Creek project</p><p>The Pony Creek project is located on Nevada's prolific Carlin trend, immediately south of Gold Standard Venture's Railroad project and 20 kilometres south of the Nevada Gold Mines joint venture's Rain and Emigrant gold mines. Pony Creek totals 81 square kilometres of prospective mineral tenure and hosts multiple Carlin-type gold occurrences, including the Bowl and West zones, and multiple untested exploration targets.</p><p>In 2018, Contact Gold made a new gold discovery at Pony Creek's Stallion zone, with near-surface oxide gold mineralization in drilling over a 2.3-kilometre strike length.</p><p>During 2020, the company anticipates continuing exploration on the Pony Creek property.
